![Work mode](src/main/resources/screenshot1.png?raw=true "Work mode")

![Break mode paused](src/main/resources/screenshot2.png?raw=true "Break mode paused")

### How to use

Open the latest JAR from [releases](https://github.com/heikikiisler/pomodoro/releases). Java 8 or higher required.

To set your custom times, double click on the timer and enter the times in minutes in WORK:BREAK format (25:5 for standard Pomodoro).
To change the current running timer time without changing defaults, double click on the timer and enter the time in minutes.

### Features

* Configurable work and break times (in minutes)

* Timer stays on top of other windows (still minimizable)
* Default position remembering after closing

### Ideas for new features and changes

* Adding options to a right-click menu to reduce confusion
* Let timer run past 00:00
