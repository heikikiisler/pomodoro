# pomodoro

Simple timer for using the Pomodoro technique with configurable work and break times.

### How to use

The executable JAR is found in the *out/artifacts/Pomodoro_jar* directory.

To set your custom times, just double click on the timer and enter the times in minutes in WORK:BREAK format.

### Ideas for features and changes

* Different color for when break timer finishes (orange instead of red)
* Collect data for run times

### Bugs

* When time runs out, time defaults are changed and timer is started, the timer numbers will stay red.
* Windows 10: interacting with the taskbar will hide the timer if they're on top of each other
